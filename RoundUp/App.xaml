    We are a CBE (Continuoue Background Execution) app. 
    
    Notice above that we subscribe to the RunningInBackground event. We also configure ourselves
    for CBE in WMAppManifest.xml by setting BackgroundExecution to "LocationTracking".
    
    CBE apps are listed in the background task control panel on the phone, in the list of "apps 
    that might run in the background." Because background execution potentially consumes more 
    battery power, the user always has the option to block any or all of these apps from running.
    
    To qualify as as CBE app you must:
    
    1. Set BackgroundExecution to LocationTracking in the manifest
    2. Handle the RunningInBackground and set a flag. This flag should be used to carry out
       only the minumum of operations (i.e don't try and update the UI) 
    3. Handle being restarted (i.e. via a toast)
    4. Actively be tracking location
    
    If the user turns off CBE, we disable location tracking when the app is deactivated, this 
    makes sure the OS turns off CBE (because we're not tracking location).
    
    Because continuously using the GPS sensors can consume a lot of battery power, we force
    CBE off (by turning off location tracking) if there's not an active roundup session.
    
    We also allow the user to set the ability for this app to run while the lock screen is engaged.
