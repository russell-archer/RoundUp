This file describes the various request/response messages, notifications and important events used by RoundUp.

Events
------

Event:			Connected
Raised By:		MicrosoftPushNotificationService
Handled By:		MainViewModel.InitMpns() PropertyChanged lamba
Notes:			When the app starts MainViewModel.InitMps() calls MicrosoftPushNotificationService.Register() to
				register the device with the MPNS cloud service. MNPS will raise a ChannelUriUpdated event to provide
				a device-unique URI which we can use to communicate with it. The ChannelUriUpdated event is handled
				by MicrosoftPushNotificationServiceOnChannelUriUpdated() and re-raised as the Connected event

Handled By:		MainViewModel.InitRoundUpService() PropertyChanged lamba
