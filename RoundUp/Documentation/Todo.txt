TODO
----

*	For those that don’t have app, generate link to bing map of location and share via sms, email, twitter, etc.

*	Make videos of how to use roundup and put on youtube

*	Add feedback and bug report forms to web site

*	Move help and about into a separate pages

*	Allow the inviter to "block" an invitee in the invitee list - kicks them off the session

		+ Link to the store (to review)
		+ Button to send link to the app via SMS, email, etc.

*	Add a send error report feature (means adding back release build support for Logger)?

*	Localization

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marketing:
---------
*	DONE: Register app at DVLUP

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Testing
-------

*	DONE: Use the Simulation Dashboard to simulate slow connections, etc.

*	DONE: Use the "Store test Kit" (right-click the project in Soluton Explorer) to determine app readiness
		- http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/hh394032(v=vs.105).aspx
		- The map seems to be causing "poor response" red-flags
		- If we comment-out the map control then responsiveness is good. Nothing to be done about that

*	DONE: Setup multiple different sessions:
		+ Make sure that there's no cross-posting of notifications
		+ Test of cancelling one session doesn't affect the onther

*	DONE: Complete Store Test Kit check-list for release 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DONE FOR 1.0
------------

*	Implement inviter and invitee cancellation

*	When starting a new session, default to creating the RoundUp point at the inviter's current location.
	Also allow the inviter to tap on the map where they'd like the RoundUp point to be
	
*	For certification requirements, must provide a preference setting to allow the user to turn off location services
	(even if the app won't then function correctly)

*	For invitees. When they accept an invite find some way of asking if they're going to be driving or walking. Enable/disable
	features like pedestrian features, and so accordingly

*	Add a Meet-Up panorama item (only for invitees). Allow the invitee to send a msg to the inviter
	And make the Invitees and Meet-Up panorama items data bound to the IsInviter and IsInvitee properties

*	Distance from invitee to meet-up point. Show distance as part of the invitee's map pushpin. Also include that info in the
	inviter's list of invitees (GeoCoordinat.GetDistantTo(EndPoint))

*	ReverseGeoCode - add to invitee's pushpins and to the meet-up point pushpin

*	Add background tracking (for invitees only)

*	Add timeouts to all network (i.e. RoundUpService) operations and check for no network

*	Test app with the LIGHT theme :-)

*	Add a menu item allowing the user to try and resume the previous session

*	Add an About box, with:
		+ Logo
		+ Developed by "RArcher Software Ltd." (link to rarcher.net)
		+ Link to support info
		+ Twitter handle
		+ App version
		+ Link to purchase if in trial mode
		+ Link to review/rate in store
		+ Privacy policy (plus link to privacy policy on web)

*	Add code for free trial and upgrade to paid version

*	Add a purchase reminder after 10 launches; also when trial is about to expire

*	Certification requirements: 
		+ Provide a mechanism through which the user can later opt out of having the location information 
		  accessed, uploaded or shared
		  
		+ Your app must periodically remind users or provide a visual indicator that location data is being 
		  sent to any other service or person:

			- For inviter: Add message to end of new session creation messagebox (NewSessionSuccess msg)
			- For invitee: Add new messagebox to on successful accept invite (AcceptInviteSuccess msg)

		+ If your app uses the Microsoft Push Notification Service, the app and the use of the Microsoft 
		  Push Notification Service must comply with the following requirements:
 
			- The app must first describe the notifications to be provided and obtain the user’s express 
			  permission (opt-in), and must provide a mechanism through which the user can opt out of 
			  receiving push notifications

			  > Add a permission dialog similar to the location permission dialog to be shown on first use
			  > Add a new setting to opt-out of MPNS use

*	Documentation. Create text table showing, for each Session and Invitee table insert/update:
		+ The request msg sent with the update and the rows Status column afterwards

*	Roundup location change support:
		+ Only allow the inviter to specifiy a location other than their current location
		  as a roundup point BEFORE the session starts (additional support in v1.1)

*	Add menu item to change map color

*	When an invitee arrives, remove the location marker from the map and invitee list

*	Add menu item to display a map control panel (overlays map), that features:
	+ Change Zoom
	+ Change Pitch (0..75)
	+ Change Heading (0..360)
	+ Turn landmarks on/off (map.LandmarksEnabled)
	+ Turn pedestrian features on/off (map.PedestrianFeaturesEnabled)
	+ Night color mode on/off
	+ Change catographic mode (road, aerial, hybrid, terrain, etc.) ( map.CartographicMode = MapCartographicMode.Road, etc.)

*	Handle long-running app issues (MPNS Channel URI connection status has changed unexpectedly to Disconnected)

*	Support for background running:
	Create a MessageBoxHelper class that handles all requests for displaying 
	messageboxes and toasts (both foreground and background)

*	Create a flip tile - see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/jj206971(v=vs.105).aspx

*	Add hard-coded limit (10) on number of invitees allowed on a session. Add rules to the Azure invitee 
	insert script. Add new response code (ERR_TOO_MANY_INVITEES)

*	Bugs:
		+ Sometimes (i.e. central London) we're not able to get the route - dubug LocationService.GetRouteAsync

*	Turned on background location tracking and run under lock screen by default.
	Decide if we want running under the lock screen and background tracking to be on by default
	If so, review privacy statement for refs 

*	Waiting for MPNS:
		+ Add OperationHasCompleted flag that will enable/disable menu items and buttons
		+ Add timer that goes off after 30 secs to allow user to cancel

*	Add a Help panorama (similar to the accept invite panorama)

*	Add map features:
		+ Allow clicking on an invitee in the invitee list to center the map on that person

*	Power-saving:
		+ If the app's deactivated and there's no active session, turn off location sensors

*	Bugs:
		+ Check out the way we try to re-connect MPSN after the connection status unexpected changes to disconnected (after having app open for a while)

*	Update the location service movement threshold if we're an invitee *driving* to the meet-up point
		+ Handle the location change event and see if the distance between
		  the new and previous locations are > the driving threshold, only then fire the notification

*	Remove all non-critical error console.error() statements from Azure scripts

*	Bugs:
		+ Invitee session when mpns became disconnected, after re-connection the menu bar was shown as for an open (not set) session, although session completed ok
		+ When driving we're flagging ourselves as "arrived" too soon (distance "close" calc needs update)
		+ When MPNS disconnects and we then re-connect, seems OK for an inviter, but for an invitee internal state seems wrong - 
		+ Re-connect MPNS after the connection status unexpected changes to disconnected (after having app open for a while)
		+ Map is not remembering view settings

*	Adjust frequency of location update notifications for long trips (> 100km?)

*	Add terms and conditions text re not using for safety-critical purposes

*	Provide a way to center map on curent location

*	Change font size for panorama app title

*	Add support details to web site

*	Ensure hardware back button works correctly (needs special processing for accept invite and help panoramas)

*	Fix font color on map controls - not showing with light phone theme

*	Ensure that the initial get-location attempt is OFF if the user disallows use of location services (tracking should also be off)
	Also disable features that require mpns if no permission

*	Add setting for toast notifications on/off

*	Change all timestamps be be universal time

*	Up-scale AMS to standard model

*	Get the go-live tokens from the app store to enable production use of the map control

*	Screenshots for all different screen sizes

*	Azure scheduled script to clean-up completed or abandoned sessions (or any session > 24hrs old)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DONE FOR 1.1
------------

* Added a timeout (20 secs) for the inital "getting your location" progress bar
