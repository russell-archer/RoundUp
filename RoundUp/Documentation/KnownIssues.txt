Know Issues
-----------

*	Failure to connect to MPNS.

	Network routing issues can prevent the device from connecting to the service.  
	The most common problem is related to proxy configuration. The phone uses Web 
	Proxy Auto Detect (WPAD) protocol to retrieve a proxy configuration script.  
	Note that the phone only uses the first proxy returned by the script.  
	Alternately, you can manually configure a proxy for a WiFi network. 
	The Push client cannot work behind a SOCKS proxy. If the device transitions 
	to a network that requires a SOCKS proxy, it will not be able to use the 
	MPNS service.
